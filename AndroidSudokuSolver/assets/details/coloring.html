          <p class="style13" align="justify">Colouring is a technique 
similar to forcing chains in that it looks for chains of connected 
cells. But while forcing chains consider cells with only two candidates 
that are connected by sharing a candidate, colouring considers cells 
where a particular candidate occurs for only two cells in a unit (row, 
column or block.)</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">Consider this example:</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify"><img src="coloring_files/col1.jpg" height="245" width="298"></p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">(Note: The 1s in brackets 
{1} mark the cells where 1 appears as a candidate (along with other 
candidates) - they do not show the cell contents.) This example contains
 two separate conjugate chains - marked by orange/green and pink/blue. 
We're only interested in part of the orange/green chain, as colouring 
can show that r8c4 cannot be a 1, by considering the chain r8c3 =&gt; 
r4c3 =&gt; r5c1 =&gt; r5c4. The logic goes like this:</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">if r8c3 is 1 then<br>
            r8c4 cannot be 1 as both cells occupy the same row.</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">if r8c3 is not 1 then<br>
            r4c3 must be 1 (because column three must contain a 1 somewhere), so<br>
            r5c1 cannot be 1, as it is in the same block, so<br>
            r5c4 must be 1 (because row five must contain a 1 somewhere), so<br>
            r8c4 cannot be 1.<br>
            So, in either case, we've shown that r8c4 cannot be 1, we've eliminated a candidate.</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">The conjugate chain for the
 above example is r8c3 =&gt; r4c3 =&gt; r5c1 =&gt; r5c4. Since this is a
 chain of conjugate cells, the links have alternate truth states - 
indicated by the green and orange shading in the above example, either 
the green cells must be true, that is, hold a 1, or the orange cells, 
but not both. Any other cells in the grid that share a unit with both a 
link having a true state, and a link having a false state, cannot hold 
the candidate and that candidate can be eliminated. This is how 1 was 
eliminated for r8c4 above.</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">Here's another example:</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify"><img src="coloring_files/col2.jpg" height="248" width="298"></p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">In this example, we can 
show that the blue cells cannot hold the 8. This is because if r9c5 
holds 8, then, following the conjugate chain, so must r8c4, and since 
both cells are in the same block, they can't both hold 8. This means 
that none of the blue cells can hold 8, and so all the pink cells must. 
Note r4c4 and r8c4, and r9c5 and r9c8 are not conjugates, and so cannot 
be used to colour each other, because of the candidate 8 in r9c4, </p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">When a unit has only two 
cells with a particular candidate, those cells are "conjugates" of each 
other, and are said to be "strongly linked". From the rule of Sudoku, we
 know that one of these cells must hold the number, and other cannot. 
Conversely, if we know that one of the cells cannot hold the number, 
then the other must. This allows us to form chains of cells, with 
successive cells having alternate "colours". (The term "colouring" is 
used because the technique is analogous to marking up the grid using 
coloured pens.) We don't know which colour represents the true state, 
but examination of the chain may enable us to make deductions leading to
 the elimination of candidates. </p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">Multi-Colouring: It is sometimes possible to connect together apparently separate chains.</p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify"><img src="coloring_files/col3.jpg" height="245" width="298"></p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">The separate conjugate 
chains are indicated by different colour shading of the cell background 
(Note: this is different from the other examples, where colours indicate
 alternative conjugate cells). Take a close look at the pink and green 
chains, because they can be joined together. Cells r8c2 and r8c9 are 
weakly linked. They're not conjugates, or strongly linked, as there is 
another cell with a candidate 4 in the same row. Weakly linked cells 
means that one being true will cause the other to be false, but one 
being false does not cause the other to be true. The pink/green chains 
both have two cells that are weakly linked to cells in the other chain, 
r8c2 and r8c9, and also r5c2 and r5c8. What's more, these cells are 
linked to opposite links in the true/false alternate states (indicated 
by the red/black colouring of the 4s.) So, if r5c2 is true, then r5c8 is
 false, and then, because of the green conjugate chain, r8c9 is true. 
Alternatively, if r5c2 is false, then because of the pink conjugate 
chains, r7c7 is true, and so r8c9 is false, and then, because of the 
green conjugate chain, r5c8 is true. In other words, the two weak links 
have now joined the two separate chains into one strongly linked one. 
The net effect in the above example is that the candidate 4s in r5c3 and
 r8c7 can both be eliminated as they both share units with strongly 
conjugated cells. </p>
          <p class="style13" align="justify">This technique is known as 
"simple colouring.", and "multi-colouring" when apparently separate 
colouring chains can be joined. There are also other colouring 
techniques, for example "super-colouring", a technique that makes 
deductions by combining the implications from conjugates of all 
candidates for all cells, although this technique is beyond the ability 
of most, if not all, human solvers.</p>
